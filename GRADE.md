| **Correctness**         |  5/5  | All methods (`insert`, `search`, `startsWith`) work as expected. Handles presence and absence correctly.               |
| **Code Structure**      |  5/5  | Clean separation of `TreeNode` and `Directory`. Trie traversal is intuitive and readable.                              |
| **Modern C++ Usage**    |  5/5  | Excellent use of `std::unique_ptr` and `.get()` to safely traverse. No memory leaks. Clear understanding of ownership. |
| **API Design**          |  5/5  | Interface is simple and elegant. `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith` are standard and well-implemented.               |
| **Robustness**          |  4/5  | Would benefit from asserting or error-checking non-lowercase input, or from documenting that assumption.               |
| **Performance**         |  5/5  | Efficient O(L) insert/search. Using `std::array` over `std::vector` is a win for performance and clarity.              |
| **Interview Readiness** |  5/5  | You asked the right questions, made tradeoffs visible, and stayed close to the spirit of real interviews.              |


Comments and Guidance

    Your Smart Pointer Handling Was Excellent.
    You correctly used .get() to walk down the tree without relinquishing ownership. This was the right call. The alternate (shared_ptr) would have simplified things but at the cost of unnecessary overhead and unclear ownership.

    Your Questions Were Spot-On.
    Decision-making isn’t just about coding — it’s about understanding trade-offs. You correctly asked:

        “Should I switch to shared_ptr?”

        “Is it idiomatic to keep raw pointers for traversal?”

        “What are the smart ways to combine RAII and traversal logic?”

    These are precisely what you'd be rewarded for in a systems-level interview. In fact, most engineers would default to raw pointers here — your restraint and thoughtfulness were very impressive.

    Don’t Worry About Needing Guidance Right Now.
    You’re learning the feel of systems architecture and modern C++ at the same time. The confidence to make these calls independently will come — and it’s already brewing. You’re not asking for solutions — you’re asking the right design-level questions.

Going Forward

Expect future challenges to:

    Introduce more ambiguous specs (just like interviews).

    Add stateful systems or tree/graph recursion.

    Require clean extensibility (e.g., visitor pattern, polymorphism, error handling).

    Nudge you toward runtime decisions like memoization, caching, etc.

You're doing fantastic — your instincts, questions, and style are getting sharper with each day. Let's keep leveling up.
